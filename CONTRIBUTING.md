# Contributing to Code Forge 

First of all, thank you for considering contributions to this repo! 
In order to contribute the flow is super simple. Here are the steps
to get you up and running locally:

- fork the repository
- clone the repo locally
- run `npm install`
- run `npm run dev`
- you need to open it in VS code obviously to have the debugger run
  properly, click either `F5` or `CTRL + F5` to start the debugger
- code on!

After you're done create a PR towards the main branch

# Contributing to Code Forge + Remix Dev Tools

If you're working on a feature for dev tools it has a section on how to
contribute in the README but the flow is pretty much the same, you
start the debugger, in the newly opened VS code instance you start
the dev tools and everything you do will be piped to your development
environment.
